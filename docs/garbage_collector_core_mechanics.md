# Interdimensional Garbage Collector: Core Mechanics Development Guide

## Core Gameplay Loop
The fundamental player experience will revolve around:
1. Generating waste items
2. Collecting waste
3. Managing resources
4. Applying basic upgrades

## Code Requirements

### Core Classes
1. **WasteItem Class**
   - Properties:
     * Unique Identifier
     * Dimensional Origin
     * Stability Rating
     * Recycling Potential
     * Rarity
     * Value

2. **GameManager Class**
   - Responsibilities:
     * Manage overall game state
     * Handle waste generation
     * Track player resources
     * Manage upgrades

3. **ResourceManager Class**
   - Track:
     * Recycling Points
     * Total Waste Collected
     * Current Upgrade Level

### Core Mechanics Methods
1. Waste Generation Methods
   - Random waste item creation
   - Variety of waste types
   - Basic rarity system

2. Collection Mechanics
   - Add waste to collection
   - Calculate resource gains
   - Basic scoring system

3. Upgrade System
   - Simple upgrade paths
   - Incremental improvements
   - Resource cost calculations

## UI Requirements

### Main Screen Components
1. **Waste Generation Area**
   - "Generate Waste" button
   - Waste item display grid/list

2. **Resource Display**
   - Recycling Points total
   - Total Waste Collected
   - Current Upgrade Level

3. **Upgrade Section**
   - Simple upgrade buttons
   - Upgrade cost display
   - Current upgrade status

## Image and Asset Requirements

### UI Elements
1. Basic Button Icons
   - Generate Waste
   - Collect
   - Upgrade
   - Reset/New Game

2. Waste Item Representations
   - Generic waste item placeholders
   - Different colors/styles for rarity levels

3. Background Imagery
   - Simple industrial/sci-fi background
   - Minimal but thematic design

### Waste Item Visual Variations
- 3-5 basic waste item sprite variations
- Color coding for different rarities
- Simple pixel art or vector styles

## Initial Development Checklist

### Coding Priorities
- [ ] Create WasteItem generation logic
- [ ] Implement basic resource tracking
- [ ] Develop simple upgrade mechanism
- [ ] Create basic UI interactions

### UI Development
- [ ] Design main game screen layout
- [ ] Implement waste generation button
- [ ] Create resource display
- [ ] Add basic upgrade interface

### Asset Creation
- [ ] Create placeholder waste item sprites
- [ ] Design basic UI button icons
- [ ] Develop simple background imagery

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Features
1. Generate unique waste items
2. Collect and track waste
3. Basic resource accumulation
4. Simple upgrade mechanism
5. Functional user interface

## Testing Focus Areas
- Waste generation randomness
- Resource gain mechanics
- UI responsiveness
- Basic gameplay loop enjoyment

## Recommended First Steps
1. Set up basic project structure
2. Implement WasteItem generation
3. Create simple UI
4. Add basic resource tracking
5. Implement minimal upgrade system

## Performance Considerations
- Keep waste generation lightweight
- Optimize list/grid management
- Minimize computational complexity in initial version

## Potential Expansion Points
- More complex waste generation
- Advanced upgrade paths
- Dimensional exploration mechanics
- Deeper recycling systems

## Development Notes
- Start extremely simple
- Focus on core gameplay feel
- Be prepared to iterate quickly
- Prioritize fun over complexity
