# Interdimensional Garbage Collector: Concept Variations

## 1. Multiverse Waste Taxonomy System

### Core Concept
- Develop a comprehensive classification system for waste from infinite realities
- Each piece of trash has a unique "dimensional waste signature" with multiple attributes:
  - Origin Reality Type (e.g., Technological Waste, Biological Byproducts, Quantum Residue)
  - Waste Stability Rating
  - Recycling Potential
  - Environmental Hazard Index

### Unique Mechanics
- Waste sorting becomes a primary progression mechanism
- More complex classification unlocks deeper recycling capabilities
- Trash items can be combined or compared across different dimensional types
- Research tree focused on understanding multiverse waste ecosystems

### Trash Generation Possibilities
- Procedurally generated waste with:
  - Randomized origin stories
  - Unique combination of dimensional attributes
  - Potential for millions of unique trash variations
- Each piece of trash tells a story of its reality's consumption patterns

## 2. Dimensional Waste Resonance Collection

### Core Concept
- Trash is not just garbage, but "echoes" of alternate realities
- Collection is about capturing unique dimensional waste frequencies
- Some trash items resonate with multiple realities simultaneously

### Unique Mechanics
- Waste Tuning System
  - Use specialized equipment to "analyze" trash histories
  - Different scanning methods reveal different trash aspects
- Resonance Mapping
  - Track how waste from different realities interconnects
  - Some trash becomes more valuable when grouped with specific other items
- Dimensional Contamination Management
  - Trash can shift, merge, or disappear based on dimensional pressures

### Trash Generation Approach
- Waste items have layered complexity
- Base object + Dimensional Overlay + Recycling Characteristics
- Potential for creating unique combinations that tell complex stories of consumption

## 3. Quantum Probability Waste Collector

### Core Concept
- Trash exists in a state of quantum uncertainty
- Collection is about capturing "potential" rather than fixed waste
- Players manipulate probability to collect and process trash

### Unique Mechanics
- Probability Collapse Mechanism
  - Trash exists in multiple states until analyzed
  - Different analysis techniques reveal different waste properties
- Quantum Waste Synthesis
  - Combine partial waste items from different realities
  - Create entirely new recycling solutions through quantum interactions
- Dimensional Instability Economy
  - Some trash is more valuable due to its improbability
  - Rare waste combinations become highly sought after

### Trash Generation System
- Waste generated through:
  - Probability algorithms
  - Quantum state interactions
  - Emergent complexity from simple waste generation rules

## 4. Waste Divergence Archive

### Core Concept
- Collect trash that represents major technological or cultural turning points
- Each piece of garbage is a physical manifestation of a "what if" scenario in waste production

### Unique Mechanics
- Divergence Point Tracking
  - Understand how waste production changes across realities
- Waste Reconstruction
  - Piece together alternate consumption histories
  - Trash serves as "evidence" of different potential waste ecosystems
- Temporal Recycling Ripple Analysis
  - Understand how processing one piece of trash might change other realities

### Trash Generation Approach
- Technological pivot point generation
- Waste creation based on speculative consumption scenarios
- Infinite possibilities of "alternate waste" items

## 5. Existential Complexity Waste Collectors

### Core Concept
- Trash is not just objects, but representations of entire conceptual waste ecosystems
- Collection involves understanding fundamental differences in consumption patterns

### Unique Mechanics
- Conceptual Waste Mapping
  - Trash represents entire philosophical or technological waste paradigms
  - Collect "waste concepts" as much as physical objects
- Reality Waste Interference Research
  - Understand how trash from one reality might influence another
- Existential Waste Complexity Scoring
  - Rate trash based on its fundamental uniqueness

### Trash Generation System
- Generate waste based on:
  - Technological waste variations
  - Consumption paradigm shifts
  - Waste mutation algorithms

## Design Philosophy
- Embrace the complexity of interdimensional waste
- Make collection feel like environmental research
- Provide players with a sense of infinite recycling possibilities
- Create systems that are simple to interact with but deep in complexity
