# Interdimensional Waste Management Facility: Base Upgrade System

## Core Base Upgrade Concept
The player manages a transdimensional waste processing facility that can be progressively expanded and improved. The base itself becomes a key gameplay mechanic, providing recycling capabilities, unlocking new technologies, and serving as a visual representation of the player's waste management expertise.

## Base Structural Components

### 1. Facility Sections
- **Waste Storage Wing**
  - Initial capacity: Small sorting room
  - Upgradeable to massive, multi-dimensional waste archive
  - Each upgrade increases waste storage and preservation capabilities

- **Recycling Laboratory**
  - Starts as a basic processing center
  - Upgradeable to advanced dimensional waste transformation facilities
  - Unlocks more complex waste analysis and recycling technologies

- **Dimensional Stabilization Chamber**
  - Initial: Rudimentary containment area
  - Advanced upgrades allow for more complex waste interactions
  - Reduces dimensional contamination of processed materials

- **Expedition Preparation Center**
  - Basic initial setup
  - Upgrades improve waste collection success rates
  - Unlock new dimensional exploration technologies

## Upgrade Mechanics

### Upgrade Currency and Resources
- **Recycling Points (RP)**
  - Primary upgrade currency
  - Generated by:
    * Processing waste items
    * Successful dimensional expeditions
    * Rare waste discoveries

- **Dimensional Potential**
  - Secondary resource
  - Collected from high-stability waste items
  - Used for advanced technological upgrades

  - Cause waste item degradation
  - Reduce recycling effectiveness
  - Create random dimensional waste events

### Waste Synergy Mechanics
- Upgraded facilities improve waste item interactions
- Certain waste combinations become recyclable
- Create unique recycling opportunities

## Visual Progression
- Base visually transforms with each upgrade
- New processing areas unlock and become explorable
- Holographic displays become more complex
- Lighting and technology levels improve

## Upgrade Challenges
- Limited upgrade resources
- Strategic decision-making
- Balance between breadth and depth of upgrades

## Technical Implementation Suggestions

### Upgrade System Class
```csharp
[System.Serializable]
public class FacilityUpgrade 
{
    public string UpgradeName;
    public int CurrentLevel;
    public int MaxLevel;
    
    public float RecyclingPointCost;
    public float DimensionalPotentialCost;
    
    public Dictionary<string, float> LevelBenefits;
    
    public bool CanUpgrade(float currentRP, float currentDimensionalPotential)
    {
        return CurrentLevel < MaxLevel && 
               currentRP >= RecyclingPointCost && 
               currentDimensionalPotential >= DimensionalPotentialCost;
    }
    
    public void ApplyUpgrade(ref float currentRP, ref float currentDimensionalPotential)
    {
        if (CanUpgrade(currentRP, currentDimensionalPotential))
        {
            CurrentLevel++;
            currentRP -= RecyclingPointCost;
            currentDimensionalPotential -= DimensionalPotentialCost;
            
            // Implement level-specific benefits
            UpdateFacilityCapabilities();
        }
    }
    
    private void UpdateFacilityCapabilities()
    {
        // Implement specific upgrade effects for waste processing
    }
}
```

## Recommended Development Approach
1. Implement basic upgrade framework
2. Create initial facility sections
3. Develop resource generation mechanics
4. Add visual progression elements
5. Balance upgrade costs and benefits
6. Implement save/load for facility state

## Design Philosophy
- Make upgrades feel meaningful
- Provide clear progression path
- Encourage strategic decision-making
- Create a sense of growing interdimensional waste management expertise
