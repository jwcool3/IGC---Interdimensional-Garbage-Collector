# Additional Pixel Art UI Element Prompts

## 1. Waste Item Detail Popup
```
A 64x64 pixel art icon representing a detailed waste item information window. Design a stylized holographic display that looks like an industrial scanning interface. The icon should feature a central rectangular frame with technical readouts, quantum analysis lines, and dimensional origin indicators. Include small pixel-detailed elements like energy scanners, microscopic circuitry, and subtle dimensional distortion effects. Use a color palette of steel blues, industrial grays, and occasional bright recycling green highlights. Add technical details like blinking data points, energy wave indicators, and hints of quantum scanning technology. The overall design should suggest a high-tech, scientific approach to waste analysis with an industrial, slightly chaotic aesthetic.

## 2. Dimensional Contamination Meter
```
A 64x64 pixel art icon depicting a complex contamination tracking interface. Create a vertical meter with a central containment tube filled with shifting, unstable liquid that represents dimensional waste contamination. The liquid should change colors from clean blues to contaminated greens and threatening purples as contamination increases. Surround the meter with technical readouts, quantum stabilization indicators, and small pixel-detailed warning symbols. Include mechanical elements like pressure gauges, energy conduits, and subtle digital flickering. The design should feel like a critical safety monitoring system for interdimensional waste management, with an industrial and slightly ominous aesthetic.

```
A 64x64 pixel art icon representing a quantum stability calculation interface. Design a complex scientific instrument with multiple calculating elements: quantum interference patterns, dimensional stability graphs, and technical readouts. Include small pixel-detailed elements like energy wave calculations, quantum circuit patterns, and subtle dimensional grid lines. Use a color palette of deep industrial blues, steel grays, and occasional bright purple quantum highlights. Add dynamic elements like pulsing energy calculations, shifting quantum patterns, and technical scanning effects. The icon should suggest the complexity of managing dimensional stability in waste collection.
```

## 6. Resource Conversion Interface
```
A 64x64 pixel art icon depicting a waste-to-resource conversion system. Create a complex machine with multiple conversion chambers, energy transformers, and resource output indicators. Show the transformation of raw waste into usable resources through pixel-detailed energy flows and mechanical processing elements. Use a color palette of industrial grays, steel blues, and bright recycling green highlights. Include dynamic elements like energy conversion waves, resource output meters, and subtle quantum transformation effects. The design should capture the technical process of turning interdimensional waste into valuable resources.
```

## 7. Emergency Waste Containment Alert
```
A 64x64 pixel art icon representing a critical waste containment alert system. Design a warning interface with pulsing alert indicators, dimensional containment field visualizations, and emergency processing elements. Use a color palette dominated by warning reds, industrial grays, and occasional bright green stabilization highlights. Include pixel-detailed elements like flickering alert symbols, energy containment field patterns, and technical warning readouts. The icon should feel urgent and technical, suggesting the critical nature of managing interdimensional waste contamination.
```

## 8. Waste Collection Probability Calculator
```
A 64x64 pixel art icon showing a complex probability calculation interface for waste collection missions. Create a technical display with quantum probability graphs, dimensional scanning indicators, and mission success predictors. Use intricate pixel work to show shifting probability lines, quantum interference patterns, and technical readout elements. Employ a color palette of industrial blues, steel grays, and occasional bright purple quantum highlights. Add dynamic elements like shifting probability waves, scanning energy effects, and subtle dimensional grid lines. The design should capture the scientific complexity of predicting waste collection success.
