# Detailed Pixel Art Background Prompts for Interdimensional Garbage Collector

## 1. Main Menu Background
```
A 1920x1080 pixel art background depicting an expansive interdimensional waste processing facility interior. The scene captures a massive circular chamber with towering recycling arrays and dimensional stabilization equipment. Mechanical conveyor systems wind through the space, transporting bizarre waste items from different realities. Holographic displays flicker with complex waste classification data and interdimensional trash maps. The architectural style blends industrial decay with quantum technology - rusted metal structures interwoven with glowing quantum circuits. Subtle dimensional rifts shimmer at the edges, suggesting the facility exists between multiple waste-generating realities. Use a limited color palette of industrial grays, steel blues, and occasional bright recycling green highlights. Add microscopic pixel details like moving waste particles, data streams of trash classifications, and hints of ongoing waste processing. The background should feel both scientifically precise and chaotically industrial, with layers of depth that invite exploration of interdimensional garbage collection.

## 2. Waste Collection Background
```
A 1920x1080 pixel art background representing a vast, multi-level waste storage and processing facility. Imagine a cavernous space with multiple levels of industrial containment chambers, each holding waste items from different dimensional realities. The architecture combines rusted metal structures with quantum-stabilization technology. Soft industrial lighting and energy fields separate different waste processing zones, creating a sense of controlled dimensional contamination. Background details include suspended walkways, holographic waste classification panels, and hints of ongoing recycling processes. Lighting should be dramatic - muted industrial grays with occasional bright green recycling energy pulses. Add pixel-detailed elements like tiny waste sorting drones moving between containment units, energy conduits pulsing with dimensional waste information, and subtle dimensional distortion effects. The color palette should be predominantly industrial grays and steel blues, with occasional bright highlights suggesting the unique nature of interdimensional waste. Include microscopic details that suggest the complexity of waste management - quantum stabilization fields, contamination reduction systems, and hints of advanced recycling technology.

## 3. Recycling Tab Background
```
A 1920x1080 pixel art background of an advanced interdimensional waste recycling laboratory. The scene depicts a massive, multi-level facility with complex quantum recycling arrays, dimensional waste analysis chambers, and cutting-edge waste transformation equipment. Imagine a space that feels both hyper-technological and slightly chaotic - with architectural elements that suggest the complexity of processing trash from multiple realities. Holographic data streams flow between recycling stations, showing complex waste transformation algorithms. The color palette should be a gritty combination of industrial grays, steel blues, and occasional bright recycling green energy highlights. Add intricate pixel details like moving waste particles, quantum circuit recycling patterns, and subtle dimensional distortion effects. Include recycling teams working at various stations, with tiny pixel-detailed animations suggesting ongoing waste transformation processes. The background should feel alive with potential - energy flows, moving waste streams, and hints of breakthrough recycling technologies. Add atmospheric effects like soft industrial energy halos, dimensional stabilization fields, and hints of technologies that push the boundaries of waste management.

## 4. Facility Upgrade Background
```
A 1920x1080 pixel art background showing the evolution of an interdimensional waste management facility. The scene is a cross-section of a multi-level facility that demonstrates progressive technological advancement in waste processing. Start with a basic, rudimentary recycling station at the bottom level, with each subsequent level becoming more advanced and complex. Use a design that suggests industrial growth and technological transformation - quantum-infused recycling elements that seem to evolve and adapt. The color palette should transition from muted industrial grays at the lower levels to more vibrant steel blues and recycling greens at the higher levels. Add pixel-detailed elements like tiny waste processing researchers, moving energy pathways, and technologies that seem to exist between different states of waste management. Include subtle architectural details that suggest dimensional waste manipulation - rooms that seem to shift, energy conduits that look like living recycling networks, and hints of technologies that defy current waste processing understanding. The background should tell a story of constant evolution, with each upgrade fundamentally changing the nature of interdimensional waste management.

## 5. Main UI Panel Background
```
A 1920x1080 pixel art background representing the primary interface of an interdimensional waste processing control room. Imagine a vast, circular command center with multiple holographic displays, quantum waste data streams, and complex technological interfaces for managing trash from multiple realities. The design should feel both industrially precise and chaotically complex - a space where interdimensional waste management happens at the cutting edge of possibility. Use an industrial gray base color with intricate network patterns in steel blues and recycling greens. Add pixel-detailed elements like moving waste classification streams, subtle quantum energy flows, and hints of dimensional waste technology. The background should have depth and complexity - multiple layers of holographic interfaces, energy conduits, and waste processing data visualizations. Include subtle atmospheric effects like soft industrial energy halos, dimensional grid lines, and hints of technologies that exist between known waste management principles. The color palette should be predominantly industrial grays and steel blues, with occasional bright highlights that suggest the potential of interdimensional garbage collection.
